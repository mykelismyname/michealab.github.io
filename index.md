I am Research Scientist at the [CHIL Lab](https://www.liverpool.ac.uk/civic-health-innovation-labs/)
which brings together experts from the University of Liverpool, NHS (Merseycare), Local government, Charities and other industry
partners to tackle local and global health challenges using civic data and technology.

My role contributes data science, AI (NLP) and Research expertise on health data Science projects, from ideation, conception
and feasibility assessments to proof of concept, design and implementation. 
Previously, I worked as an NLP Research Scientist at [NEC Laboratories Europe (Heidelberg)](https://www.neclab.eu/), where I 
worked on Open Information Extraction in the healthcare space.

I am also a member of the the ECR supported by the AIM-RSF[https://www.turing.ac.uk/research/research-projects/ai-multiple-long-term-conditions-research-support-facility]
 under the Alan Turing Institute. 

Besides Machine learning, Data Science and Artificial Intelligence, I have in the past had experiences in software, mobile app development, networks and systems
administration and Open web activism through Mozilla Foundation.

## Main projects
- [MRIC](https://mric.uk/) 
  - Developing digital resources (data and language models) to accelerate practical utility of categorical diagnosis and their codes in patient care delivery and data mining in EHRs.
- [DynAIRx](https://www.liverpool.ac.uk/dynairx/our-research/) 
  - Developing language models to determine which combination of drugs are most harmful to patients with multiple long term conditions
- [Outcome Tracking] 
  - To come
- .....

## Research Interests

My research interests span applications and topics pertinent to Machine learning and Natural language processing (NLP). I have particularly worked on problems such as information extraction, text generation and others with an objective of simplify the way humans understand and communicate through written text. I'm keen on Representation learning, Few-shot & Zero-shot learning, Multi-task learning, Natural Language Generation, Non-autoregressive language generation, Entity recognition, Prompt based learning, Information retrieval, Multi-label text classification etc.
