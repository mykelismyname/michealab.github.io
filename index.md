I am currently working as Research Scientist on health data Science projects
[DynAIRx](https://www.liverpool.ac.uk/dynairx/our-research/) and [MRIC](https://mric.uk/) at [CHIL Lab](https://www.liverpool.ac.uk/civic-health-innovation-labs/)
in liverpool. I previously worked as an NLP Research Scientist at
[NEC Laboratories Europe (Heidelberg)](https://www.neclab.eu/) on Open Information extraction in Healthcare. 

Besides Machine learning, Data Science and Artificial Intelligence, I have in the past had experiences in software, networks and systems administration. I recently completed my PhD in Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing (NLP) specializing in Biomedical Information Extraction at the University of Liverpool working with [Danushka Bollegala](https://danushka.net/), [Paula Williamson](https://www.liverpool.ac.uk/population-health/staff/paula-williamson/) and [Susanna Dodd](https://www.liverpool.ac.uk/population-health/staff/susanna-dodd/).

## Research Interests

My research interests span applications and topics pertinent to Machine learning and Natural language processing (NLP). I have particularly worked on problems such as information extraction, text generation and others with an objective of simplify the way humans understand and communicate through written text. I'm keen on Representation learning, Few-shot & Zero-shot learning, Multi-task learning, Natural Language Generation, Non-autoregressive language generation, Entity recognition, Prompt based learning, Information retrieval, Multi-label text classification etc.
